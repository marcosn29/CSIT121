 <h2>i love food</h2>
 <p>Food is something i look foward to everyday. my favorite food is tamales my mom has been making the same tamales since forever. Every year on christmas it is tradition to eat my moms tamales. Every time my friends call me to make plans we always end up going out to a mexican restaurant to get tacos. My favorite foods are tamales, burritos, 
 pizza, burgers, and tacos but i am open to trying new foods.</p>
