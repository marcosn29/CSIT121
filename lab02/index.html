			<p>When i started going to the gym i realized in order for me to have a good workout i needed something nutritious. I searched all around the web but i couldnt seem to find something that i could take with me on the go. I started cooking chicken with rice and beans before the gym but i was running late because my friend was picking me up to go to the gym so i threw everything onto a flour tortilla, added a couple of things i like and after that i fell in love with my chicken burrito it is easy and its full of protein.</p>
